# Screw Label Generator

Generates labels for organizing screws. A sample of the generated file looks like this:
![Sample labels for screws of varying sizes generated by the script](https://github.com/spauka/screw_labels/blob/master/imgs/sample.png?raw=true)

The label sizes are optimized for Avery 46x11-R labels.

## Building
To rebuild, first run the python file to generate a list of screw variants into `screws.dat`. Then
run lualatex to generate the labels. You can edit the python file `variants.py` to change which screw
sizes, materials and heads are generated.
```console
$ python3 variants.py > screws.dat
$ lualatex screws.tex
```
